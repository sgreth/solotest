# Solo

SOLO is a roommate matching application for students who attend UNC Charlotte. Our goal is give new students the opportunity to view, match, and communicate with other students who want to live in similar on-campus housing locations. Using our dynamic matching algorithm, Students will be allowed to see a match percentage for every other user and be able to sort between potential roommates. Students will also be allowed to add users to groups and communicate with each in order to effectively build the best college dorm living experience.
